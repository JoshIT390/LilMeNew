	<b>Title</b>: <u>Curious George Goes Camping</u><br><br>
	<b>Author</b>: H. A. Rey <br><br>
	<B>Summary:</b> <br>
		A man brings a curious monkey out of the jungle and into civilization and the monkey and the man explore the new worlds and consequences created from those decisions. <br><br>
	
	<b>Lessons Learned:</b><br>
		1. It is not inherently bad to be curious.  It is natural and normal to be curious.
	<br><br>	
		2. Curiosity comes from a desire to find answers to questions and a want to learn.
<br><br>
		3. Sometimes when you try to do things beyond your aptitudes, you will fall, and others will be needed to rescue you.  (Curious George trying to fly like a bird).
	<br><br>
	<b>Continue the Learning!:<br> </b>
		1. Ask your child what other moral, humorous, or innovative ideas were inside the story?
		<br><br>
		2. The often heard phrase "Curiosity killed the cat" is challenged in this story. How can you phrase that curiosity is not a bad thing?
	<br><br>

<!--	<b>Notes from the teacher:</b>  <br>
		I'm guessing monkeys are John's favorite animal. Out of all the books John and I have read, this one looks like his favorite. He was even pretending to make monkey sounds during reading time!
